##### JavaScript code

source.addEventListener("ready", (e) => {
  // Should be "7tv-event-sub.v1" since this is the `v1` endpoint
  console.log(e.data); 
}, false);

source.addEventListener("update", (e) => {
  // This is a JSON payload matching the type for the specified event channel
  console.log(e.data);
}, false);

source.addEventListener("open", (e) => {
  // Connection was opened.
}, false);

source.addEventListener("error", (e) => {
  if (e.readyState === EventSource.CLOSED) {
    // Connection was closed.
  }

```ts
interface EmoteEventUpdate {
  // The channel this update affects.
  channel: string; 
  // The ID of the emote.
  emote_id: string; 
  // The name or channel alias of the emote.
  name: string; 
  // The action done.
  action: "ADD" | "REMOVE" | "UPDATE"; 
  // The user who caused this event to trigger.
  actor: string; 
  // An emote object. Null if the action is "REMOVE".
  emote?: ExtraEmoteData; 
}

interface ExtraEmoteData {
  // Original name of the emote.
  name: string;
  // The visibility bitfield of this emote.
  visibility: number;
  // The MIME type of the images.
  mime: string;
  // The TAGs on this emote.
  tags: string[];
  // The widths of the images.
  width: [number, number, number, number];
  // The heights of the images.
  height: [number, number, number, number];
  // The animation status of the emote.
  animated: boolean;
  // Infomation about the uploader.
  owner: {
    // 7TV ID of the owner.
    id: string;
    // Twitch ID of the owner.
    twitch_id: string;
    // Twitch DisplayName of the owner.
    display_name: string;
    // Twitch Login of the owner. 
    login: string;
  };
  // The first string in the inner array will contain the "name" of the URL, like "1" or "2" or "3" or "4"
  // or some custom event names we haven't figured out yet such as "christmas_1" or "halloween_1" for special versions of emotes.
  // The second string in the inner array will contain the actual CDN URL of the emote. You should use these URLs and not derive URLs
  // based on the emote ID and size you want, since in future we might add "custom styles" and this will allow you to easily update your app, 
  // and solve any future breaking changes you apps might receive due to us changing.
  urls: [[string, string]];
}
