# Legacy EventAPI Documentation

_This version is deprecated and will eventually be discontinued. Please update to v3_

### GET /v1/channel-emotes

This API is an example of [ServerSentEvents](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Server-sent_events/Using_server-sent_events)

This Endpoint takes in query paramaters with the name `channel` as the channel name ie. `troydota` or `anatoleam`.

An example urls are:

1. `https://events.7tv.app/v1/channel-emotes?channel=troydota&channel=anatoleam`

2. `https://events.7tv.app/v1/channel-emotes?channel=troydota,anatoleam`

3. `https://events.7tv.app/v1/channel-emotes?channel=troydota+anatoleam`

4. `https://events.7tv.app/v1/channel-emotes?channel=troydota%20anatoleam`

There is also a websocket API on this same endpoint.

If you connect to `wss://events.7tv.app/v1/channel-emotes` your connection will be handled as a websocket.

To join a channel,

```json
{
  "action": "join",
  "payload": "troydota"
}
```

To part a channel,

```json
{
  "action": "part",
  "payload": "troydota"
}
```

Upon doing either a join or a part this you will receive an event:

```json
{
  "action": "success",
  "payload": "join"
}
```

or an error

```json
{
  "action": "error",
  "payload": "<reason>"
}
```

You can also specify multiple channels, the same ways you would in the query string.

When an event is fired you will receive this:

```json
{
  "action": "update",
  "payload": "{\"channel\":\"troydota\",...}"
}
```

Every 30 seconds you will receive a ping, you do not need to respond to it.

```json
{
  "action": "ping"
}
```

The payload is a stringified json payload.

You can request to listen up 100 channels per connection.

#### Events

1. `ready` this event is emitted when the connection is fully established and ready to receive events
2. `update` this event is emitted when an update happens.
3. `heartbeat` this event is emitted to force the connection to stay open and is sent every 30 seconds.

#### JavaScript code

```js
const source = new EventSource(
  "https://events.7tv.app/v1/channel-emotes?channel=troydota&channel=anatoleam"
);

source.addEventListener(
  "ready",
  (e) => {
    // Should be "7tv-event-sub.v1" since this is the `v1` endpoint
    console.log(e.data);
  },
  false
);

source.addEventListener(
  "update",
  (e) => {
    // This is a JSON payload matching the type for the specified event channel
    console.log(e.data);
  },
  false
);

source.addEventListener(
  "open",
  (e) => {
    // Connection was opened.
  },
  false
);

source.addEventListener(
  "error",
  (e) => {
    if (e.readyState === EventSource.CLOSED) {
      // Connection was closed.
    }
  },
  false
);
```

## JSON Payloads

### EmoteEventUpdate

```ts
interface EmoteEventUpdate {
  // The channel this update affects.
  channel: string;
  // The ID of the emote.
  emote_id: string;
  // The name or channel alias of the emote.
  name: string;
  // The action done.
  action: "ADD" | "REMOVE" | "UPDATE";
  // The user who caused this event to trigger.
  actor: string;
  // An emote object. Null if the action is "REMOVE".
  emote?: ExtraEmoteData;
}

interface ExtraEmoteData {
  // Original name of the emote.
  name: string;
  // The visibility bitfield of this emote.
  visibility: number;
  // The MIME type of the images.
  mime: string;
  // The TAGs on this emote.
  tags: string[];
  // The widths of the images.
  width: [number, number, number, number];
  // The heights of the images.
  height: [number, number, number, number];
  // The animation status of the emote.
  animated: boolean;
  // Infomation about the uploader.
  owner: {
    // 7TV ID of the owner.
    id: string;
    // Twitch ID of the owner.
    twitch_id: string;
    // Twitch DisplayName of the owner.
    display_name: string;
    // Twitch Login of the owner.
    login: string;
  };
  // The first string in the inner array will contain the "name" of the URL, like "1" or "2" or "3" or "4"
  // or some custom event names we haven't figured out yet such as "christmas_1" or "halloween_1" for special versions of emotes.
  // The second string in the inner array will contain the actual CDN URL of the emote. You should use these URLs and not derive URLs
  // based on the emote ID and size you want, since in future we might add "custom styles" and this will allow you to easily update your app,
  // and solve any future breaking changes you apps might receive due to us changing.
  urls: [[string, string]];
}
```
